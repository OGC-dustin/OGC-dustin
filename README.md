Hi, Iâ€™m Dustin at OGC.Engineering where we do Embedded Consultation, Design and Engineering<br>
My career path is focused toward Mobile Robotics and Unmanned Vehicle Systems<br>
Every project I work on I learn something new or improve my skills...  From baremetal ( OODA, State Machine, etc. ) to embedded Linux ( Yocto, Buildroot, etc. ) and analysis of embedded systems<br>

You can contact me at dustin < at > ogc.engineering<br>
